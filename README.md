Question:
The best solution for defining edit UX flow is to edit after long-pres on item using "AlertDialog".
In my implementation i used "AlertDialog" to verify that the user wants to delete the item,
on the other hand its easy to insert into the "AlertDialog" the ability to modify the item.
A lot of apps use the same UX-flow so its easy for users to figure out this flow in their first
usage. This solution is easy to implement (my implementation got the "AlertDialog" implemented,
and its easy to modify). This flow is consistent because most of other apps use the same flow.
